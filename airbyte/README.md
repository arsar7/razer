Work In Progress.....

We might be able to remove some services from the docker compose file
in particular, things like init and seed...

We need to create a new volume folder that maps connectors with Airbyt's connector folder running inside the docker container 
this way we can develop our custom connectors and put them in connectors folder, run local tests and that should be it.
